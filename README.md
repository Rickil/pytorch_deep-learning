# Deep Learning Projects with PyTorch

## Project 1: Image Classification on Tiny-ImageNet

### Overview

Welcome to the "Image Classification on Tiny-ImageNet" project! This deep learning project aims to classify images from the Tiny-ImageNet dataset using PyTorch.

### Dataset

The Tiny-ImageNet dataset is a subset of the larger ImageNet dataset, consisting of 200 classes. For this project, 20 classes have been selected for a manageable training time.

### Project Tasks

The project is divided into several exercises, each with the goal of improving the image classification model.

### Important Note

- The Tiny-ImageNet dataset provides a challenging yet valuable dataset for training and testing the model.

### Results

The goal is to create an accurate and efficient image classification system, with the best possible results on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset.


## Project 2: Few-Shots Learning on Tiny-ImageNet

### Overview

The "Few-Shots Learning on Tiny-ImageNet" project is an exciting exploration into the capabilities of few-shots learning models. This project benchmarks various models' performance in a few-shots learning scenario using the Tiny-ImageNet dataset.

### Project Tasks

The project involves selecting a small number of classes and images to train a model that can effectively generalize from limited data. The tasks include visualizing support sets, adapting existing networks for few-shots learning, and testing the models' performance with query images.

### Important Note

- Few-shots learning presents a unique challenge in machine learning, requiring models to make accurate predictions with minimal training data.

### Results

The project aims to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different few-shots learning approaches. The results will provide insights into the models' ability to learn quickly and efficiently, which is crucial for applications where data is scarce.
